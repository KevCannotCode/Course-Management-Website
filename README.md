The course management website is a collaborative tool aimed at professors and teaching assistants. Professors can assign new classes to their teaching assistants, add, modify, and delete courses. Teaching assistants can also view courses on a dashboard to manage their time effectively. The front end was built with Bootstrap, while the back end uses the Django framework and SQLite as a database.
